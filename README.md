THE PROBLEM

The Palmoria Group, a manufacturing company based in the Nigeria is
embroiled in issues bordering on gender inequality in its 3 regions.
Unfortunately, the media recently published in the news with the
headline “Palmoria, the Manufacturing Patriarchy” This doesn’t look
good for the owners of the business based on their ambition to scale
the business to other regions and even overseas. Cases like this can
only spiral downwards revealing other issues like gender pay gap
amongst other possible issues.
